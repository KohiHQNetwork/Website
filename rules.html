<h1><strong>GENERAL</strong></h1>

<p>1. <strong>Do NOT post videos that are unrelated to KohiHQ.</strong> This means that a majority of the video you are posting has to be about KohiHQ.</p>

<p>9. <strong>Do NOT Hackusate.</strong> If you think somebody is cheating, use /report.</p>

<p>10. <strong>Do NOT evade a ban or a mute.</strong>&nbsp;Doing this may result in a blacklist. To appeal a ban/mute, visit https://discord.kohihq.net</p>

<p>11. <strong>Do NOT play with players who are ban evading.</strong> If you are caught, you too will be banned.</p>

<p>12. <strong>Do NOT grief or excessively harass famous players.&nbsp;</strong>Doing this will result in a warning, followed by a ban.</p>

<p>13. <strong>Do NOT stream-snipe, harass, excessively follow, or excessively trap famous players for unreasonable periods of time.&nbsp;</strong>Doing this will result in a warning, followed by a ban.</p>

<p>16. <strong>Solicitation is not allowed</strong>. Selling of accounts, in-game items,&nbsp;or specific services in-game via message or chat is <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;allowed.</p>

<h1><strong>Practice</strong></h1>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT manipulate your elo.</strong> &quot;Elo Manipulation&quot; is doing anything out of the ordinary to gain or lose elo. This includes but is not limited to giving your account for a friend to boost it, go on an alt and boost it, or purposely dying to drop elo.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT have multiple accounts on the leaderboards (TOP 10).&nbsp;</strong>Using an alternate account on Practice (as long as you are not ban evading) is allowed. However, you may not have multiple accounts on the leaderboards. Doing this will result in an elo reset on ALL accounts that are on the leaderboards and possibly a temp ban.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT camp.</strong>&nbsp;Camping/excessively running will result in a warning, followed by a kick. If you continue to do this after a warning plus a kick, you will be banned.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT exploit any bugs.&nbsp;</strong>If you find any bugs on Practice, please make sure to report them on discord.kohih.net.</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT be an idiot in voice chat.&nbsp;</strong>This is self-explanatory. Being toxic, racist, loud, etc in the team voice chat will result in a ban.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Do NOT intentionally double-click.&nbsp;</strong>If you are found double-clicking your mouse (ie: adjusting your debounce timer) you&nbsp;will be banned. Butterfly and drag clicking are allowed at your own risk. If you&#39;re using the Glorious Model O or any mouse that allows you to change your debounce ms, your debounce time should be set to 10 ms.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT help rule breakers.</strong> If you are an accessory to a rule break, you will join them. Simple!</p>

<h1><strong>SOUPPVP</strong></h1>

<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Using kit glitches or bugs that will give you an advantage over other players is NOT allowed. </strong>You will <strong>NOT</strong> be warned for&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Selling credits or similar services for real-world currency/valuables are NOT allowed.</strong></p>

<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Boosting is NOT allowed.</strong></p>

<p>4. <strong>Do NOT combat log</strong>.&nbsp;This is running out your combat timer and logging off&nbsp;when it is over. If the person stops chasing you, you may log off or /spawn.</p>

<h1><strong>Flash (HCF)</strong></h1>

<p>1. <strong>Do NOT attempt to avoid force invites.&nbsp;</strong>Any player or faction who attempts to find a loophole in the force invite rule will be removed from the network. This includes but is not limited to: using an alternate account to not use a force invite, disband a faction and reclaim for force invites to reset, make a second faction to have full force invites, ally with members who cannot join the faction because they have been cycled, etc.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT ally.&nbsp;</strong>Allying is not allowed. This includes but is not limited to: letting players in your base save them from another faction, fighting with anyone who is not in your faction. This is a simple rule, and anyone who tries to find loopholes in it will be banned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. <strong>Insiding your faction is not allowed.</strong> This includes taking items, making your faction raidable on purpose, or anything in-between. If you want to leave your faction peacefully you may do so by asking your faction leader to take the items you worked for. Please contact an admin if you&#39;re not sure your actions are considered insiding.</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT excessively&nbsp;grief.&nbsp;</strong>Excessively griefing a faction will result in a ban and the faction who was griefed will have it removed. In other words, you will waste your time and get yourself banned.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Do NOT portal trap.&nbsp;</strong>Trapping nether portals will result in a ban.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Do NOT.&nbsp;</strong>Using an alternate account is not permitted under any circumstances unless approved by a&nbsp;<em>head staff&nbsp;</em>member.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT block glitch.&nbsp;</strong>Block glitching will result in a ban. This includes but is not limited to: pearl glitching&nbsp;through a block, hitting players through blocks, using minecarts by breaking blocks in another faction&#39;s claim.</p>

<p>8.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT DTR evade.&nbsp;</strong>Kicking a player or leaving a faction to avoid DTR loss is not permitted. The nature of the death that would have occurred is irrelevant. It does not matter if the player who is kicked (or leaves) was tagged, in lava, in combat, etc. Kicking or leaving to avoid DTR loss in any circumstance is not permitted. You may not leave your faction to knock, jump in string traps, or any other reasonably risky activity that would otherwise result in DTR loss.</p>

<p>9.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT have objectional faction names.&nbsp;</strong>If a faction name is perceived as harmful, hateful, racist, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, your team name will be forcibly changed and the leader will receive a punishment.</p>

<p>10.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT keep players hostage.&nbsp;</strong>Purposely doing this will result in a warning, followed by a ban.</p>

<p>11.&nbsp;<strong>Do NOT truce during the EOTW FFA.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>12.<strong>&nbsp;&quot;Spectators&quot; who watch fights just to break Totems will be banned</strong></p>

<p><ins><strong>Specifically Allowed:</strong></ins></p>

<p>1. Killing your faction if you get kicked and given no warnings to leave the base.</p>

<p>2. Drowning players in traps.<br />
<br />
3. Killing /f ally members (when applicable).</p>

<p>4. Using blocks to suffocate logged-out players.<br />
<br />
5. &quot;Griefing&quot; for the sole purpose of destroying a string trap to escape the trap.</p>
